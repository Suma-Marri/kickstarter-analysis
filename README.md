# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise is a playwright who wants to kickstart a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play. She has a play, Fever, ready and she also has has a big budget of $10,000. 

### Purpose
Before she starts anything, she wants to analyze pervious crowdfunding data to see if there are any factors that a crowdfund campaign successful or not. We made multiple charts and graphs to predit the best tips st atart her campaign. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
According to out line grpah in Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png, shows that the best time for Louise to launch her crowdfund campaign is around May. She should avoid December - January time too, because the the success rate is lower compared to the other months. Also, crowdfund campaigns lauched during that time are usually failed or canceled more often during that time. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
According to the analysis in the file Outcome_vs_Goals.png, the lower the goal, higher the chances of successfully reaching that goal. As shown in the line graph, you can see that once you have over $10,000 goal, the success rate is lower than the failed or cancel rate. With Louise's budget of $10,000, she has a high chance of successfully reaching her goal price. However, if she is still concenered with her chnaces of reaching her goal, she needs to put a little more effort or decrease her budget a little. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Something I had trouble with was when I was creating the analysis on the outcomes based on goals, I noticed that after creating the chart, there were lots of records missing. I decided to change most of the formulas I used from less than (<) to less than and equal to (<=) and greater than (>) to greater than or equal to (>=). By doing so, I was able to get more records in the analysis and make my analysis more accurate. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
